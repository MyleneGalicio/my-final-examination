   My name is Mylene N. Galicio, 20 years of age born on April 22, 2001 at San Roque, Bulusan, Sorsogon. 
I am second year college in Sorsogon State College- Bulan Campus taking a course of Bachelor of Science 
in Information Technology. In this course I have no assurance if i want or i love this course because to be 
honest i am a person that i dont know what i want to be in future. A dreams that I want to be taken. But i am 
sure that someday i will find that job or dreams because all of us are want to be a successful in the future. 
So, all we need is to take a process even it is a long process because all of this are plan of God. 
   I am a child of Marivic N. Galicio and Melchor F. Galicio, I have three(3) sisters and three(3) brothers.
To our family I am the type of person that so boring and shy type. I love watching movies, reading books, watching 
on social media, and also playing online games. In sports,to be honest i don't have. In love issue, i am a type of 
person that so attaching. I am attached in the both gender, yes i am bisexual- a person who attached on girl and boy. 
I felt this my preferences since I was young i'm a girl but supposedly i love playing with boys, i love playing a boy thingy.
Sometimes i feel like that Äºoving a same gender is a sin. Yes i admit that it is a sin especially to a God 
but i am thinking that about loving its haven't a sin ,but i am believing and hoping that LOVE are not choosen, it is unconditional
to love a person.
