Git is used to store the source code for a project and track 
the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows
 developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by 
providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from
 multiple developers. GitHub allows developers to change, adapt
 and improve software from its public repositories for free, but
 it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans. 
Each public or private repository contains all of a project's files, 
as well as each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple
 collaborators and can be either public or private.
